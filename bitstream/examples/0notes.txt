Convolution (box filter) bitstreams

- convfixed
  This one is the best so far.  With memhack and allones input, it
  does something semi-readable, puts out sixes.

- debugconv
  An older bitstream, I think this is the one with MUL999 weirdness.

- conv_bitstream_new
  An even older bitstream, has wires to nowhere I think.
